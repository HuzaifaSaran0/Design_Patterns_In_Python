## 1. Memento Pattern


### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The Memento Pattern is used to capture and restore an objectâ€™s state without exposing its internal details.
It is especially useful for implementing Undo / Redo or Checkpoint / Restore functionality.

### ðŸ”‘ Roles in My Code

#### Originator (Editor)

     The main object whose state we want to save/restore.

     Editor has content, and can create a state (snapshot) or restore one.
```python
def create_state(self): 
    return EditorState(self._content)
def restore(self, state): 
    self._content = state.get_content()
```

#### Memento (EditorState)

    Stores a snapshot of the state at a particular moment.

    Doesnâ€™t allow modification (read-only).

    In my code â†’ EditorState holds _content.

#### Caretaker (History)

    Manages the collection (stack) of saved states.

    Doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s inside the state, just pushes/pops them.

    In my code â†’ History stores EditorState objects.

### ðŸ“Œ Important Detail (Undo Style)

    My History.pop() removes the latest snapshot and returns the previous one.

    That means:

      After "C", when undo â†’ "C" is discarded, and "B" is restored.

      This matches the Undo behavior of editors.
