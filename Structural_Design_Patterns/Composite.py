# ðŸŒ³ Composite Pattern (Structural)
# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

# The Composite Pattern lets you treat a group of objects and a single object in the same way.
# group of objects -> (composite) and single object -> (leaf)
# Itâ€™s great when you have tree-like structures.

# ðŸ§© Easy Example

# Imagine youâ€™re building a File Explorer:

# File â†’ single item (leaf).
# Folder â†’ can contain files or other folders (composite).

# You want to be able to do things like:

# open()
# delete()
# get_size()

# ðŸ‘‰ With Composite, you can call these methods on both files and folders, without caring if itâ€™s a single file or a folder with many things inside.
